This is a project for the tech screening of Mag Mutual.

### Description:
At MagMutual we are always building new microservices that replace older monolithic systems.
This project is a smaller feature set of what we do on a weekly/monthly basis.
We would like you to build a Microservice that exposes a couple endpoints to return the
following information. We would also like a simple UI to display the information.
We have provided a CSV of user information; we would like you to build to build the following
endpoints:
- Endpoint to return a specific user (and all associated information)
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession
- Custom Endpoint that you design on your own.
  Assumptions:
- You can build it in any language/framework combination that you like, or feel is best.

Assumptions:
- You can build it in any language/framework combination that you like, or feel is best.

Deliverables:
- The artifacts or link to the source code.
- Answer the following questions:
  - What did you think of the project?
    - The project has a lot of room for creation and self-expression in the code. It's a simple enough project that also demands good architectural design and understanding of a chosen language.
  - What didnâ€™t you like about the project?
    - Nothing. It lets you get as in depth as you want, or you can be as broad as you want. 
  - How would you change the project or approach?
    - For individual roles you're targeting you might want to add conditional criteria to the prompt. I.e. if you're going for a devops role, add that they need to use github interactions or an architecture role would need to have a design doc. 
  - Anything else you would like to share?
    - Nope. Fun tech screening, and I'm excited to talk about my code :)

### Execution steps:
```
go build
go run .
